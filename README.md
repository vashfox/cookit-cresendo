# Crescendo Collective - Frontend Skill Test

## Tasks
1. Convert PSD to working webpage, including the modal (desktop only)
2. Integrate Recipe API on the page.

Bonus: Do the mobile design
 
## Goals

For this project we've provided a PSD design and recipe API with two endpoints. With these you'll need to complete the following objectives.

- Pull the PSD design from `/design` folder.
- Pull the data from the API
- Display all the recipes on the page and open the recipe detail on a modal using the provided design
- Ingredients with a matching `ingredientId` listed in the specials response should also show the special `title` and `text` under the ingredient name

This project includes a API server (json-server) for you to use. To install and run, use the commands below:

- `npm i`
- `npm run start:api` Start Dummy Server (ex. http://localhost:3001/)
- `npm run dev` Start UI (ex. http://localhost:5173/)

Once running, you can use the API endpoints listed in the following section from `http://localhost:3001`. More information about querying the server can be found on the [json-server github page](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Bonus Items
